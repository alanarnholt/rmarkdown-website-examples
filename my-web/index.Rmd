Welcome to my very experimental website created with [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html).  I am having a hard time deciding whether I want to use jeckyll for my web page and have a blog or just stick with straight R Markdown.

My research and teaching interests include computational statistics and reproducible research.
